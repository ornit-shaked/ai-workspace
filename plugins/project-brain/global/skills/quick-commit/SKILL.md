1. Run `git status` to see the current state
2. Run `git diff` to understand the changes
3. Stage all changes with `git add -A`
4. Create a commit with a clear message that:
   - Starts with a type prefix (feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:, test:, chore:)
   - Briefly describes what changed
   - Uses imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

Example: `feat: add product search functionality`
